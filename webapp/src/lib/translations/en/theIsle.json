    "content": "The Isle is an unusual open-world survival horror game in which you play as either a carnivore or a herbivore. Choose from several dinosaurs with different strengths and weaknesses, start as a cub and try to survive as long as possible. Your opponents are other players and the constant search for food and water. Buy \"The Isle\" now for €19.99 and experience the currently best dino survival game on Steam.",
    "heading2": "Survival isn't easy",
    "content2": "Like many survival games, The Isle prides itself on its high level of difficulty and lack of readily available information. If you're playing the game for the first time, expect to die early and potentially often as you learn what you must do to survive in a world where almost everything is out to kill you. The biggest challenge is often just finding food - after all, when you're in the role of a carnivorous dinosaur, every meal comes from the hunt. If you can take the frustration of an early game, you'll discover a unique gaming experience that puts its dinosaur characters front and center. The lovingly rendered jungle island environments and dinosaur models create a game that looks like no other.",
